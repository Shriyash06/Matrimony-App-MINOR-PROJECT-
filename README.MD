I have successfully completed a full-stack web page similar to Shaadi.com using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and EJS. The application supports full CRUD operations: users can Create a new profile, Read or view existing profiles, Update profile information such as salary or city, and Delete profiles. The backend uses MongoDB for storing profile data and Mongoose for data modeling. I implemented form handling, server-side routing, and method overriding to support PUT and DELETE requests from HTML forms. The frontend is built with EJS templates to dynamically display data. Overall, the project demonstrates a complete and functional CRUD web application.
